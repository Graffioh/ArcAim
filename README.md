# ArcAim
An arcade aim based game, made in **SFML** with C++.

Try to reach the highest score within 20 seconds, but remember, You got only 80 HP and every miss is a penalty (-10 HP), so be careful ;)

# Functionality
The target spawn time is 0.5 seconds, max health 80, countdown 20 seconds.
I will implement everything to modify the game experience later on with a menu.

Press R to Restart the game and P to pause.

# Build and compile
**IMPORTANT!** For now if You want to build and compile you need to open the .sln project with Visual Studio Community (not Code).

# Socials
Enjoy and let me know (with a DM on Twitter: @graffioh or Discord: Graffioh#2823) anything useful to get better coding wise :)
