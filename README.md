# ArcAim
An arcade aim based game, made in **SFML** with C++.

Try to reach the highest score within 20 seconds, but remember, You got only 80 HP and every miss is a penalty (-10 HP), so be careful ;)

# Functionality
+ Target spawn time: 0.5 seconds
+ Health: 80
+ Countdown: 20 seconds

I will implement everything to modify the game experience later on with a menu.

Press **[ R ]** to Restart the game and **[ P ]** to pause.

## Framerate

Normally the game is capped at 300 fps, if you want something else: 

Press 
+ **[ F1 ]** for vsync (I don't know if it actually works)
+ **[ F2 ]** for 60 fps cap
+ **[ F3 ]** for 144 fps cap.

There could be weird input lag if you are on 60hz and the game is capped on 144/300 fps, so if you play on 60hz cap it to 60 fps.

# Build and compile
**IMPORTANT!** For now if You want to build and compile you need to open the .sln project with Visual Studio Community (not Code).

# Socials
Enjoy and let me know (with a DM on Twitter: @graffioh or Discord: Graffioh#2823) anything useful to get better coding wise :)
