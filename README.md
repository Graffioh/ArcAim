# ArcAim
An arcade aim based game, made in **SFML** with C++.

Try to reach the highest score, but remember, every miss is a penalty (-10 HP), so be careful ;)

# Functionality
Press **[ R ]** to Restart the game , **[ P ]** to pause, **[ESC]** for a fast Restart.
## Difficulty:

**Default**
+ Target spawn time: 1 seconds
+ Health: 100
+ Countdown: 20 seconds

If you want something else go into "OPTIONS" and change the difficulty by choosing:

**Easy**
+ Target spawn time: 1.2 seconds
+ Health: 120
+ Countdown: 20 seconds

**Medium**
+ Target spawn time: 0.7 seconds
+ Health: 100
+ Countdown: 20 seconds

**Hard** (*if you want a serious challenge*)
+ Target spawn time: 0.5 seconds
+ Health: 70
+ Countdown: 20 seconds


## Framerate

Normally the game is capped at 240 fps, if you want something else: 

Press 
+ **[ F1 ]** for vsync (I don't know if it actually works)
+ **[ F2 ]** for 60 fps cap
+ **[ F3 ]** for 144 fps cap.

To avoid weird input lag just cap the fps accordingly to your monitor refresh rate.

# Build and compile
**IMPORTANT!** You have 2 options:

1) Build and compile with Visual studio community (just open the project .sln).

2) Build by opening the console in the main folder, write mingw32-make  and then open the .exe in the Exec folder.

(MinGW 64 bit compiler required: https://www.msys2.org/ )
