# ArcAim
An arcade aim based game, made in SFML with C++.

Try to reach the highest score within 20 seconds, but remember, You got only 80 HP and every miss is a penalty (-10 HP), so be careful ;)

The target spawn time is 0.5 seconds.

I will implement everything to modify the game experience later on with a menu.

Example of early prototype gameplay:
